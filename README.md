# ThirdEye

An APP developed in order to recognize text, colour and object.
Following are the features the app provides :
1.Color Detection
2.Optical Character Recognition(OCR)
3.Feature Matching
4.Image Matching using histogram analysis
5.Object Recognition whose domain is restricted to electrical components like Breadboard , SSD etc.

#### PREREQUISITES
